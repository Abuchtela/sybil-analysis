# Sybil Analysis

There are multiple stages to sybil analysis:

* Data Gathering
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis & Pattern Finding
* Qualitative Review of Trail and Patterns

## What this repo does?

This project aims to gather as much data as possible for a particular grant from different networks. In this case ZkSync, Polygon and Mainnet. We can extend this tool to gather data from other chains as well to give a complete picture of activity and connections.

This tool makes is easy to find common patterns amongst the connected accounts. This data also makes it easy to generate graphs from the collected data for easy visualization.

Collected data creates at the end a Graph with Adjacency List Data Structure which can be visualised as well on a GUI by common tools.
